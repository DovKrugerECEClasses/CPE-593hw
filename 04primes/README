The first line should contain an integer n

Using eratosthenes' sieve, print all the primes until n.

The second line should contian a much bigger integer p.  Using Fermat
and Miller-Rabin, execute k=6 trials and for each one print out the
witness and whether it is still considered prime. If you find proof
that the number is composite you may stop immediately.

For example, given the file:

20
561

the output should be:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
Fermat
2 still prime
5 still prime
13 still prime
19 still prime
21 still prime
23 still prime

Miller-Rabin
2 composite
