Read in the file 02.dat
The first line consists of three tokens

A single integer stating the size of the list, followed by the word
RANDOM or READ to indicate that the list is to be randomly generated
or read from the file, and last the word DISPLAY indicating that the
list should be printed before and after sorting.

If the word RANDOM is used generate a list of n random integers each
from 0 to n-1.  Duplicate numbers are permitted.


For example:

5 RANDOM DISPLAY

could generate a list: 4 1 3 2 2
and will then print out:
4 1 3 2 2
1 2 2 3 4
1 2 2 3 4

and
8 READ PRINT
9 1 11 2 0 3 7 4

specifies the 8 numbers in the file and prints out:
0 1 2 3 4 7 9 11
0 1 2 3 4 7 9 11

if the first line does not contain the word PRINT then just print how
long each sort takes and print true if they agree, false if they do
not.

results match

Sort the numbers into ascending order using quicksort and insertion sort.
Note this means you will have to COPY the data so you have two identical lists to sort.
