open a file in the current directory named 01.dat
Do not specify a directory or your program test will fail.

The format for 01.dat is a single integer n.  Compute and print all
the fibonacii numbers up to n.  Compute and print out the answer
twice.  The first time should be computed iteratively.  The second
time should be computed recursively using dynamic programming.  Your
program should be capable of handling at least n=25 without overflow.

For n=1 the output should be:
1
1

for n=2 the output should be:
1 1
1 1

for n=8:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
