Read in the file 03.dat containing a first line with an integer n, a
second line with a list of n integers, and a third line consisting of
a number to search for within the list.  Sort the list using heapsort.
Then use binary search to find the number within the list.

For example:

5
9 8 2 3 6
4

should result in the output:

NOT FOUND

because 4 is not within the list of 5 numbers, while:

15
9 8 2 3 6 8 5 2 4 5 5 15 12
5

should return the location of the 9 in the list
