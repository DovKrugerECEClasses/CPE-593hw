Read in file 07.dat and the file targets.dat The file targets.dat
contains space-separated words.  Read in all the words and put them
into a list in RAM.

Then read in file 07.dat into a string.  Search this string for each
word using Boyer-Moore and print the offset where it was found and the
word, one per line.  For example:

07.dat
This is a test of my string finding homework.  This is only a test.

targets.dat
test homeworks

output:
10 test
36 homework
62 test




Part B

Write LCS using dynamic programming so your code is no worse than O(n^2) in the number of characters in each file

Your program should use command line to open two files:

java LCS file1.dat file2.dat

or in C++

LCS file1.dat file2.dat

will print the number of characters in the longest common subsequence in the files.
